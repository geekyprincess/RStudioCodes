# RStudioCodes
Hey, these are the codes I coded in R! Realized people don't really share their codes, so on a mission to make most of my stuff online available! :) 
<-----------------------------------------------------------Coded by Geeky Ashima!------------------------------------------------->
Codes are on following topics!
1) Loaded Die 
2) Deck of Cards and shuffling
3) Creating a Slot Machine
4) Understanding Descriptive Statistics
5) Finding Confidence invtervals for various samples

Enjoy Coding! :)
